Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
给一个大小为n的数组，里面的数的范围是从1到n，求1，2..n中没有出现的数字

Example:

Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]

自己还是太笨了，如何用原先输入的数组来做到hashmap的效果呢，求负数！！
