Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

给一个二维数组，1表示陆地，0表示水，现定义一段连续区域就是岛，请找出小岛的个数

Example 1:

Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
