Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.
给一些没有overlap的interval，插入一个新的interval，要求返回新的interval


Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]

这题为什么是hard呢。。如果没有overlap就合并成一个大的interval就好
