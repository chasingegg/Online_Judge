There is a list of sorted integers from 1 to n. Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.

Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the right most number and every other number from the remaining numbers.

We keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.

Find the last number that remains starting with a list of length n.
给出1到n n个数字，先从前到后每隔一个删除，再从后到前每隔一个删除，问最后剩下的数字

Example:

Input:
n = 9,
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2 4 6 8
2 6
6

Output:
6

---------------
如果n为奇数，f(n)=f(n-1)
如果n为偶数，一次过后剩下的数为2,4,...n，如果我们知道f(n/2)的话，可以把n,n-2,...2
和1，2，... n/2中第f(n/2)个数做一个映射，n-2(f(n/2)-1) = n - 2 * f(n/2) + 2;
