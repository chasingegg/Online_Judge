You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1
给出一些硬币面值，给出凑出某个面额的最小硬币数量

Example 1:

Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

----------------
1. 用dp来做，dp[amount]表示amount的面额所要的硬币数量，但是这个方法显然在amount非常大的时候效率会比较低
