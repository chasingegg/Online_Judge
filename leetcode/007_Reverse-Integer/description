Reverse digits of an integer.

Example1: x = 123, return 321
Example2: x = -123, return -321

Have you thought about this?
Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!

If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.

Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?

For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

Note:
The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

问题很简单，就把数倒序输出一波，主要需要考虑32位int型的overflow的问题，比较傻的做法是用long存结果，然后和INT_MIN INT_MAX比较一下看是否overflow了，但这种做法真的很不real，很low。看到一种好的做法是在while循环逐步构建result的过程中看*10以后是否出现overflow。可能说不太好，还是看代码吧
