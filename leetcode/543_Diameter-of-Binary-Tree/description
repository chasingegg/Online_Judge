Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
给出树中任意两个节点距离的最大值

Example:
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5  
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

看到这道题有种似曾相识的感觉，其实就是算树的高度和算这个路径的长度是可以同时进行的
