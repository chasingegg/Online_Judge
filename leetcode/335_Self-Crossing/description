You are given an array x of n positive numbers. You start at point (0,0) and moves x[0] metres to the north, then x[1] metres to the west, x[2] metres to the south, x[3] metres to the east and so on. In other words, after each move your direction changes counter-clockwise.

Write a one-pass algorithm with O(1) extra space to determine, if your path crosses itself, or not.
给一个数组x，先向北x[0]，再向东x[1]，再向南x[2]，再向西x[3]，以此类推
判断最终能有环出现
