Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
一个n+1长的数组，每个数值在1-n之间。找出重复的那个数字

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
Note:

You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

有了限定条件以后这道题目就变得异常有趣了。
这是为什么呢，这个类似二分查找的方式可以得到正确的答案，我需要再想想。
