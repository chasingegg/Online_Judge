Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.
给出一个数组，有一个大小为k的滑动窗口，每次向右移动一格，返回窗口中
最大的数形成的一个数组

Example:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
Explanation: 

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ input array's size for non-empty array.

Could you solve it in linear time?
