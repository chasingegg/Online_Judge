Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

把一个升序数组rotate一下，然后找目标数，要求时间复杂度为logn

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

- 1 2 3 4 5
- 4 5 1 2 3
