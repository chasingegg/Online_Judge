Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
把一个增序的链表转成二叉查找树

Example:

Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5

本来想着这题是不是有什么好解法，貌似就是把链表的数据弄到数组里去，然后递归一波
