Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

求最长无重复字母的子串长度

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

1. dp问题 f[i]为第i个字符为止的最长无重复字母子串的长度，接下来主要第i+1个字符是否出现过来决定是不是要加进去。不加的话直接就是f[i],如果加则要考虑第i+1个字符开始往回找得到一个len 然后求出max(f[i],len)即可。
2. 比较高端的做法就不用开数组了
