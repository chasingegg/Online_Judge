Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

给一个0 1矩阵，返回只有1的最大区域的面积

Example:

Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6

看起来像是一个简单dp，但真的有点难。
可以用084题中计算直方图最大矩形面积来做
