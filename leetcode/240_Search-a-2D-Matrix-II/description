Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
一个二维矩阵，从左到右升序排列，从上到下也是升序排列，找一个数

Example:

Consider the following matrix:

[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
Given target = 5, return true.

Given target = 20, return false.

----------
从左下角开始搜索，如果小于target就向右，如果大于target则往上，这样的好处是只有一个
确定的搜索方向
