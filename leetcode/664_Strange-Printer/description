There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any places, and will cover the original existing characters.
Given a string consists of lower English letters only, your job is to count the minimum number of turns the printer needed in order to print it.

这道题说有一种奇怪的打印机每次只能打印一排相同的字符，然后可以在任意起点和终点位置之间打印新的字符，用来覆盖原有的字符
这题目其实有点难理解的。。

Example 1:
Input: "aaabbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
