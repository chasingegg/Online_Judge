Write a program to find the nth super ugly number.

Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list primes of size k.
质因数都在所给的质因数列表里，即为super ugly number

Example:

Input: n = 12, primes = [2,7,13,19]
Output: 32 
Explanation: [1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32] is the sequence of the first 12 
             super ugly numbers given primes = [2,7,13,19] of size 4.
