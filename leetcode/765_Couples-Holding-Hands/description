N couples sit in 2N seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands. We want to know the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

The people and seats are represented by an integer from 0 to 2N-1, the couples are numbered in order, the first couple being (0, 1), the second couple being (2, 3), and so on with the last couple being (2N-2, 2N-1).

The couples' initial seating is given by row[i] being the value of the person who is initially sitting in the i-th seat

(0,1), (2,3)...(2N-1,2N)为couple，现在给出2N个数字，问经过多少次调换
可以让couple都坐到一起

Example 1:

Input: row = [0, 2, 1, 3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We only need to swap the second (row[1]) and third (row[2]) person.
